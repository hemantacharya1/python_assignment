# ðŸ”¢ 1. List
# Time Complexity: O(n)

# Why: A list performs a linear search (checks each element one by one).

# Use Case: Fine for small collections, but slow for large ones.

# ðŸŸ£ 2. Set
# Time Complexity: O(1) on average

# Why: Sets are implemented using hash tables, which allow constant-time lookups.

# Best for: Fast membership tests, e.g., checking if an item exists in a large collection.

# ðŸŸ© 3. Dict
# Time Complexity: O(1) on average (for keys)

# Why: Also uses a hash table internally, optimized for key lookup.

# Note: value in dict checks only keys, not values.

# Best for: Fast key presence checks.

# ðŸ”· 4. Tuple
# Time Complexity: O(n)

# Why: Like lists, tuples are sequential containers, so it does a linear scan.

# Use Case: Use only if immutability is required and the size is small.
